Only subscribers can change the variable (we know the subscribers for each variable)

We need to have a global image of the changes of the variables:

A,5		A,C			C,D
B,13	A,5			C,11
A,12	A,12		D,14
C,11	C,11
D,14	A,2
A,2



P1,P2,P3, ... Pn => one is a counter


set => send intent to those who need the set
	=> after the response to the intent choose the timestamp to use for publish
	=> send to upper level after we are sure that no publish with smaller timestamp will ever arrive

compare and exchange => mid keeps track of the values
					 => do the same with the intent and timestamp
					 => success notification
